## 🔧 Quick Fix Steps:

Your website folder should look like this:

├── script.js
├── style.css
└── lookershub_logo.png
```

### Step 2: Test Locally First
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Press F12 to open Developer Tools
3. Check Console tab for any red error messages
4. If you see errors, let me know what they say

### Step 3: Common File Issues
- **File encoding:** Make sure files are saved as UTF-8
- **Line endings:** Use standard line endings (not Mac/Windows specific)
- **File permissions:** Make sure files are readable by web server
